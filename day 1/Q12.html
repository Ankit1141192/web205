    <h1>Pay After Placement</h1>
    <p>We believe that potential is evenly distributed across Indian society, but opportunity is not. <br>
        Masai is democratising education with a unique Pay After Placement (PAP) Model. <br>
        PAP allows you to study the course of your choice at â‚¹0 upfront fee.
    </p>
    <h2>Pay After Placement
        (PAP) Agreement
    </h2>
    <p>
        PAP Agreement is a legal contract that makes education at Masai outcome-based. It is not an <br>
         education loan, as you do not have to pay any interest & you do not require any collaterals. If you do <br>
         not get placed within 1 year of course completion, your learning with Masai is completely free.

    </p>
    <h3>Course Fees</h3>
    <p>These only take effect once you start earning above the PAP threshold amount for your course.</p>
